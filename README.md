# visaMonitor — US visa appointment monitor

Watches the live US visa appointment availability grid on
[qmq.app](https://qmq.app) and sends a **phone push** the moment an interview
date on or before your target date appears at any consulate you care about.
Runs itself on **GitHub Actions** (free, in the cloud, works while your computer
is off), with an optional local watch mode for ~60s reaction time.

You choose the visa type, sub-category, consulates and cutoff — see
**[Configuration](#configuration)**. All of it lives in repo Variables/Secrets,
never in this repo, so a public fork discloses nothing about *your* search.

Why a browser and not a simple `curl`: qmq.app renders its grid client-side over
a Supabase-Realtime (Phoenix) websocket — the raw HTML is empty and there is no
JSON API — so the monitor renders the page headless with Chromium and reads the
DOM.

### What an alert looks like

A per-location summary (earliest date + count, soonest location first) — not a
wall of dates. It lists **every** location with a qualifying date, and is
repeated 6× so you don't miss it:

```
H-1B · 3 locations by YYYY-MM-DD
北京: earliest 2026-09-21, 4 dates
广州: earliest 2026-10-13, 3 dates
沈阳: earliest 2026-10-15, 2 dates
```

(Tapping the notification opens qmq.app.)

### On-demand status check

Alerts only fire when a date meets your cutoff. To ask "what's the earliest slot
right now?" at any time, request a **status** — it reports the earliest date at
*every* location you watch, ignoring the cutoff, and marks with ✓ any that
already qualify. It's a single, non-urgent push and never touches the alert
dedup state, so it can't suppress a real alert.

There are two **mutually exclusive** views, both honouring your per-city
category rules (`VISA_DESC` + `VISA_DESC_BY_CITY`):

| Command | Reports | Filtering |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| `status` | **regular** slots only — what a normal applicant can book | `VISA_TYPE` + your per-city sub-category rules |
| `emergency status` | **only** rows tagged `官方紧急申请 - 不是普通号` | `VISA_EMERGENCY_TYPES`, **all** sub-categories, every city |

Keeping them separate matters: an emergency slot is often much earlier than any
regular one, so mixing them would make a location look bookable when it isn't.

The emergency view filters differently **on purpose**, because that pool is
allocated differently: the visa types in `VISA_EMERGENCY_TYPES` (default
`F-1,J-1`) draw on **one shared pool**, and its F-1 sub-categories aren't
distinguished. Applying the regular narrowing there would hide slots that are
genuinely available — so the emergency view ignores `VISA_DESC` /
`VISA_DESC_BY_CITY` and reports which visa type each location's slots came from.

Three ways to trigger:

| From | How |
|------|-----|
| **Your phone** | Send `status` or `emergency status` as a message to your ntfy topic — the running watcher replies in ~1s |
| **GitHub** | Actions → *visaMonitor H-1B* → **Run workflow** → mode `status` / `emergency-status` (works with your computer off) |
| **Terminal** | `python monitor.py --check` (add `--emergency` for the emergency-only view) |

```
H-1B status · none by 2026-12-31
广州: 2026-09-15, 48 dates (All Others, All Students, Graduate / PhD students)
武汉: 2026-10-09, 9 dates
北京: 2026-10-20, 19 dates

H-1B emergency status (官方紧急申请 only) · none by 2026-12-31
武汉: 2026-08-26, 1 date
广州: none
北京: none
```

> The phone trigger needs the **local watcher** running (only it holds an open
> connection to the topic). If your machine is off, use the GitHub trigger.

## Setup (about 5 minutes)

### 1. Get push notifications on your phone (ntfy — free, no account)

1. Install the **ntfy** app: [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/ntfy/id1625396347) · [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.heckel.ntfy)
2. Generate a private, unguessable topic name and subscribe to it in the app
   (**+ Subscribe to topic**):

   ```bash
   echo "visamonitor-$(openssl rand -hex 8)"
   ```

   > ⚠️ **Treat this like a password.** ntfy topics are unauthenticated: anyone
   > who learns yours can read every alert you receive *and* push fake ones to
   > your phone. Never commit it — keep it in a GitHub **secret** and in your
   > local (uncommitted) launchd plist only. If it ever leaks, generate a new
   > one and re-subscribe.
3. Test it from a terminal — your phone should buzz:

   ```bash
   curl -d "hello from visaMonitor" ntfy.sh/YOUR_TOPIC
   ```

### 2. Put this folder on GitHub as a **public** repo

Keep it public so Actions minutes stay free (a 5-minute cron far exceeds the
private-repo free budget). No secrets live in the code — only in step 3.

```bash
cd ~/PythonProjects/visaMonitor
git init && git add . && git commit -m "visaMonitor H-1B"
gh repo create visaMonitor --public --source=. --push   # or create it in the GitHub UI
```

### 3. Add your push topic as a repo secret

Repo → **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| `VISA_NTFY_TOPIC` | `YOUR_TOPIC` |

### 4. Turn it on and test

1. Repo → **Actions** tab → enable workflows if prompted.
2. Open **“visaMonitor H-1B” → Run workflow** (manual trigger).
3. Open the run’s log for the **Check availability** step. You want to see:

   ```
   STATUS: OK (parsed 5/5 cities)
   H-1B: no date by YYYY-MM-DD. Earliest: 广州=…; 北京=…; 上海=…; 沈阳=…; 武汉=…
   ```

   - `STATUS: OK` → the scrape works from GitHub’s servers. You’re done; it now
     runs every ~5 min automatically.
   - `STATUS: SCRAPE_FAILED (cloudflare)` → GitHub’s IP got blocked by
     Cloudflare. See **Troubleshooting** below.

That’s it. When a matching date opens, your phone buzzes with the
dates and a tap-through to qmq.app.

---

## Configuration

Set these as repo **Variables** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions →
**Variables**), *not* in the workflow file — that keeps your search private even
though the repo is public. The workflow reads them via `${{ vars.* }}`; anything
you leave unset falls back to a neutral default.

```bash
gh variable set VISA_CITIES --body "广州,北京"      # etc., one per setting
```

| Variable | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `VISA_CITIES` | Consulate cities to watch, comma-separated, Chinese names. Only cities on the default view load (the 5 China cities); others need their country tab, not yet automated. | `广州,北京,上海,沈阳,武汉` |
| `VISA_TYPE` | Visa badge prefix (matches all sub-categories) | `H-1B` (or `F-1`, `B1/B2`) |
| `VISA_DESC` | Default: narrow to one sub-category by description text (case-insensitive substring); empty = all | (empty — watch all H-1B sub-categories) |
| `VISA_DESC_BY_CITY` | **Per-city override** of `VISA_DESC`, as `城市=值` pairs. `ALL` = watch every sub-category in that city. | `上海=ALL` |
| `VISA_CUTOFF` | Alert on dates **on or before** this, inclusive (ISO) | `2026-12-31` |
| `VISA_INCLUDE_EMERGENCY` | Let **alerts** include "官方紧急申请 - 不是普通号" emergency-only slots. `0` = ignore (default), `1` = include. (Does not affect the `emergency status` view.) | `0` |
| `VISA_EMERGENCY_TYPES` | Visa badges sharing one emergency slot pool; used only by `emergency status` | `F-1,J-1` |

**Optional second channel — e-mail.** Set these two as **Secrets** (not
Variables — an address is personal) to have ntfy forward a copy of each *alert*
by e-mail. Useful because ntfy's iOS push path (ntfy.sh → Firebase → APNs) is
[known to be unreliable](https://docs.ntfy.sh/known-issues/), so e-mail gives
iPhone/Apple Watch a channel that doesn't depend on it.

| Secret | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `VISA_EMAIL` | Address to receive a copy of each alert. Empty = disabled. |
| `VISA_NTFY_TOKEN` | Access token from a free [ntfy.sh account](https://ntfy.sh/account) — **required**, since ntfy.sh rejects anonymous e-mail (`code 40053`). |

To store the token without hand-editing anything, run
[`scripts/set-ntfy-token.sh`](scripts/set-ntfy-token.sh): it prompts for the
token (hidden, so it stays out of your shell history), writes it into the
installed launchd plist, restarts the watcher, and offers to set the GitHub
secret too.

Only the **first** of the repeated copies carries the e-mail header, so one
alert = one e-mail, not six. Status replies are never e-mailed. If e-mail
forwarding fails for any reason, the push is retried without it — a broken
e-mail setup can never suppress an alert.
| `VISA_PUSH_REPEAT` | Repeat each new alert this many times (numbered `i/N`) so you don't miss it | `6` |
| `VISA_BURST_MINUTES` | Minutes of the hour when slots are released — poll fast around these. Empty = never burst. (`--watch` only) | `0,30` |
| `VISA_BURST_WINDOW` | Seconds either side of each mark that count as "near" | `60` |
| `VISA_BURST_INTERVAL` | Seconds between checks inside a burst window | `10` |
| `VISA_PUSH_INTERVAL` | Seconds between those repeats | `5` |

> **Emergency slots:** some rows are tagged `官方紧急申请 - 不是普通号` — these are
> only bookable by applicants in the emergency-request pool, so they're excluded
> by default. When you're eligible, set `VISA_INCLUDE_EMERGENCY=1` (in the plist or
> workflow) to start alerting on them too; matched emergency dates are flagged
> `⚠emergency-only` in the logs.

Changing a Variable takes effect on the next scheduled run — no commit needed.

## Run it locally (optional)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m playwright install chromium
VISA_NTFY_TOPIC=YOUR_TOPIC python monitor.py --once   # one check
python monitor.py --test-push                                # send a test push
```

## Faster: near-real-time watch mode

The GitHub Actions cron checks every ~5 min. For a faster reaction, run the
built-in **watch loop** on an always-on machine (your Mac, or a small VPS). It
keeps one browser open and re-checks every ~60s:

```bash
VISA_NTFY_TOPIC=YOUR_TOPIC python monitor.py --watch 60   # every ~60s
```

Notes and trade-offs:
- **Why it reloads each cycle:** qmq.app fetches its grid once at load and does
  **not** live-update the page (verified: zero DOM changes while open). So true
  websocket-style "push the instant it appears" isn't available from the public
  site without reverse-engineering their private realtime protocol. Reloading
  every ~60s is the robust equivalent and reacts within a minute.
- **Needs an always-on process** — unlike the GitHub cron, it dies if the
  machine sleeps/closes. Run it under `caffeinate`, `tmux`, `nohup`, or a
  launchd/systemd service.
- **Burst polling:** consulates release slots on the hour and half hour, and a
  released slot can be taken within seconds — a flat 60s poll samples those
  critical moments at random. So within `VISA_BURST_WINDOW` seconds of each
  `VISA_BURST_MINUTES` mark the loop switches to `VISA_BURST_INTERVAL`
  (default: ~10 checks across `:29–:31` and `:59–:01`, vs ~2 before), then
  returns to the normal interval. Minutes-of-the-hour are timezone-independent
  for whole-hour offsets, so `:30` local is `:30` at the consulate.
- **Be gentle:** don't go below ~30–60s outside burst windows. qmq is behind Cloudflare (Error 1015
  rate-limiting); aggressive reloads from one IP can get you temporarily
  blocked. The loop adds small random jitter and survives transient blocks.

Run it *and* the GitHub cron if you like — dedup state keeps them from
double-pinging (use separate state files / machines; they don't share state).

### Run the watcher 24/7 on your Mac (launchd)

A launchd agent ([`launchd/com.visamonitor.h1b.plist`](launchd/com.visamonitor.h1b.plist))
runs the watcher under `caffeinate`, starts it at login, and restarts it if it
dies.

The committed file is a **template** with `__PYTHON__` / `__PROJECT__` /
`__TOPIC__` placeholders, so your real paths and push topic are never committed.
Install substitutes them into `~/Library/LaunchAgents/` (outside the repo):

```bash
TOPIC="your-private-topic"                 # same value as your VISA_NTFY_TOPIC secret
PROJECT="$(pwd)"                           # run this from your clone
PYTHON="$(command -v python3)"             # must have playwright installed

sed -e "s#__PYTHON__#$PYTHON#g" \
    -e "s#__PROJECT__#$PROJECT#g" \
    -e "s#__TOPIC__#$TOPIC#g" \
    launchd/com.visamonitor.h1b.plist > ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.visamonitor.h1b.plist

launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.visamonitor.h1b.plist
launchctl enable  gui/$(id -u)/com.visamonitor.h1b
```

Manage it:

```bash
# status (look for "state = running" and a pid)
launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.visamonitor.h1b | grep -E 'state|pid'

# live logs
tail -f watch.log            # checks + alerts
tail -f watch.err.log        # errors

# restart after editing the INSTALLED plist (e.g. change interval / cutoff).
# Edit ~/Library/LaunchAgents/... directly -- do NOT copy the template over it,
# that would overwrite your real paths/topic with placeholders.
launchctl bootout   gui/$(id -u)/com.visamonitor.h1b
launchctl bootstrap gui/$(id -u) ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.visamonitor.h1b.plist

# stop + uninstall completely
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/com.visamonitor.h1b
rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.visamonitor.h1b.plist
```

**Change what it watches:** edit the `EnvironmentVariables` (city / visa / desc /
cutoff / topic) or the `--watch 60` interval in
`~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.visamonitor.h1b.plist`, then run the restart block above.

**Caveats:**
- It's a **login agent** — it starts when you're logged in, not at a pre-login
  boot screen. `caffeinate -i` blocks *idle* sleep, but **closing the lid on
  battery still sleeps** the Mac (macOS limitation); it resumes on wake.
- To edit config you change the installed plist under `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`
  (the copy in the repo is just the template).

## Pause / stop

Repo → **Actions → visaMonitor H-1B → ⋯ → Disable workflow**. Re-enable anytime.
(GitHub also auto-pauses scheduled workflows after 60 days with no repo commits.)

---

## Honest limitations

- **Free monitor, not an auto-grabber.** qmq’s paid service reacts in *seconds*.
  This tells you a slot *appeared* — it may already be taken by the time you tap
  through. It shortens your reaction time; it doesn’t book for you.
- **Timing drift.** GitHub delays scheduled runs under load; real cadence can be
  5–15 min, not a strict 5.
- **Cloudflare.** If datacenter IPs get blocked, see Troubleshooting.

## Troubleshooting

- **`SCRAPE_FAILED (cloudflare)` every run** — GitHub’s shared IPs are blocked.
  Options: (a) run it locally instead (a launchd/cron job on your Mac uses your
  home IP), or (b) route Chromium through a residential proxy. Ask and this can
  be wired in.
- **`SCRAPE_FAILED (timeout)` occasionally** — a slow render; harmless, the next
  run retries. If it’s *every* run, the site layout may have changed.
- **`EXTRACT_FAILED`** — the city name or F-1 rows weren’t found; the site’s
  markup likely changed and the selector in `monitor.py` needs a tweak.
- **No push but logs show a match** — check the `VISA_NTFY_TOPIC` secret is set
  and your phone is subscribed to that exact topic.
